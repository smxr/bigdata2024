                        identify deep technical and scientific nature of big data problems, and share the future direction on the development of
                        next-generation solutions for data-driven decision making. The conference will attract high-quality theory and applied
                        research findings in
                        <b>big data science and foundations, big data infrastructure, big data management, big data search &
                        mining, privacy/security, </b> and <b> big data applications</b>.
                        The attendees will get the opportunity to learn about the recent research results, and be able to network with some of
