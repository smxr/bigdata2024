                        identify deep technical and scientific nature of big data problems, and share the future direction on the development of
                        next-generation solutions for data-driven decision making. The conference will attract high-quality theory and applied
                        research findings in
                        <b>big data science and foundations, big data infrastructure, big data management, big data search &
                        mining, privacy/security, </b> and <b> big data applications</b>.
                        The attendees will get the opportunity to learn about the recent research results, and be able to network with some of
                        the leading luminaries, researchers and practitioners in this area. It is a unique place to identify deep technical and
                        scientific nature of big data problems, share the direction on the development of next-generation solutions for
