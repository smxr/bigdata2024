            <strong><i>Abstract</i></strong><br>
            In this talk, I will discuss a new semi-supervised learning approach that combines consistency regularization and
            pseudo-labeling, with its main novelty arising from the use of unlabeled data training dynamics to measure pseudo-label
            quality. Instead of using only the model's confidence on an unlabeled example at an arbitrary iteration to decide if the
            example should be included in the training or not, our approach also analyzes the behavior of the model on the
            pseudo-labeled examples as the training progresses to ensure low quality predictions are masked out. I will show that
            our approach brings substantial improvements on diverse text and vision benchmarks, emphasizing the importance of
            enforcing high quality pseudo-labels.

            the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC). Caragea currently serves as Program Director at the National Science
            Foundation. Her research interests are in natural language processing, artificial intelligence, deep learning, machine
            learning, and information retrieval. Caragea's work has been recognized with several National Science Foundation (NSF)
            research awards, including the prestigious NSF CAREER award. She has published many research papers in top venues such
            as ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, ICML, AAAI, and IJCAI and was a program committee member for many such conferences. She reviewed
            for many journals including Nature, ACM TIST, JAIR, and TACL, served on many NSF review panels, and organized several
            workshops on scholarly big data. In 2020-21, she received the College of Engineering (COE) Research Award, which is
            awarded to faculty in the College of Engineering at UIC for excellent research contributions. Caragea was included on an
            Elsevier list of the top 2% of scientists in their fields for her single-year impact in 2020.

            <strong><i>Abstract</i></strong><br>
            Information Retrieval and E-Commerce are seeing a great opportunity in the generative AI age. The challenge of
            maintaining relevance across a vast array of queries, especially new and obscure ones, has persisted. Despite
            significant investments by leaders like Amazon, e-commerce search still lags behind web search advancements by Google
            and Bing. Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI have renewed my optimism. These
            technologies decode user intent more accurately and handle nuanced queries, transforming e-commerce search into an
            intuitive, natural language-like experience. The advent of multimodal foundation models promises richer, personalized
            experiences by integrating text, images, videos, and voice. This shift moves e-commerce from static solutions to
            dynamic, responsive environments tailored to individual preferences. Additionally, the rise of intelligent agents and
            the fusion of physical and digital shopping through innovations like drone delivery and AR/VR will profoundly impact the
            industry. As we stand on the brink of this transformation, the key question is who will lead this revolution: tech
            giants, specialized vertical vendors, or existing e-commerce companies? In this talk, I will explore the current
            landscape of e-commerce search and outline a future where it exceeds customer expectations.
