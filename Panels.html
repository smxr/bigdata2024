                    Abstract:<br>
                    Big data technologies have been developed over the past 15 years to collect, store, manage and analyze massive amounts
                    of data for a variety of applications including in bioinformatics, cyber security, finance and manufacturing. At the
                    same time developments in deep learning and generative AI techniques have exploded in recent years to benefit society.
                    Big data technologies have played a role in these developments as massive amounts of data are needed to develop accurate
                    AI algorithms. At the same time, AI techniques are being applied for managing big data including determining the
                    appropriate optimization techniques for big data processing. The panel will explore the development in both Big Data and
                    AI and discuss how they benefit each other. We will focus on a variety of applications including in Bioinformatics and
                    Cyber Security.<br>

                    <u>Abstract</u>: This panel will bring together experts from government, industry, and academia to collaboratively explore the
                    future of <b>Big Data</b> and <b>AI</b>, with a particular emphasis on the dynamic interplay between <b>Big Data for AI</b> and <b>AI for Big Data</b>
                    in reshaping technology, innovation, and decision-making. Through this cross-sector dialogue, panelists will
                    explore cutting-edge strategies, emerging innovations, and key challenges in leveraging Big Data to accelerate AI
                    advancements, while also exploring how AI technologies are poised to transform Big Data infrastructures and applications
                    across diverse sectors.<br>
                    By focusing on the intersection of Big Data and AI, the panel will further highlight how these converging forces are
                    driving the emergence of new paradigms of intelligence that fundamentally reshape industries, government, and academia.
                    The discussion will offer valuable insights into how Big Data and AI together will drive transformative change, opening

                    Abstract: The pervasive growth of data in all sectors has propelled Big Data to the forefront of national priorities,
                    driving advancements in science, technology, and industry. Federal agencies play a pivotal role in shaping the Big Data
                    research landscape, fostering innovation, and addressing pressing societal challenges. This panel, titled 
                    <b>"Federal Big Data Initiatives and Activities,"</b> brings together officers and program directors from leading federal big data agencies
                    to discuss ongoing initiatives, strategies, and opportunities in Big Data research and development.<br>
                    Panelists will provide insights into how federal agencies are addressing the challenges of data management, security,
                    scalability, and integration across various domains. Topics will include funding priorities, interdisciplinary
                    collaboration, public-private partnerships, and the role of Big Data in advancing artificial intelligence, healthcare,
                    climate science, agriculture and food security, and beyond.<br>
                    Attendees will gain a unique perspective on how federal investments are shaping the future of Big Data research and how
                    researchers, industry leaders, and policymakers can utilize the federal big data resources and align their efforts with
                    federal initiatives. This panel offers a platform for thought-provoking discussions on the strategic directions of Big
                    Data innovation and its transformative impact on society.<br>
                    Join us for this engaging session to learn, connect, and contribute to the dialogue on federal Big Data initiatives and
                    activities shaping the next decade of data-driven innovation.<br>
