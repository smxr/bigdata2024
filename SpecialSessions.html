                        <strong>Best Papers of PSBD 2024 will be Invited for Extended Submission to a Top-Quality
                            Journal</strong><br><br>
                        <strong>Aim and Scope</strong><br>
                        The 11th IEEE Special Session “Privacy and Security of Big Data” (PSBD 2024) of the 
                        <a href="index.html">2024 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (IEEE BigData 2024)</a> 
                        follows the great success of ten previous editions co-located with the IEEE BigData and
                        ACM CIKM conference series and focuses the attention on privacy and security research issues in the context of Big Data,
                        a vibrant and challenging research context which is playing a leading role in the Database research community. Indeed,
                        while Big Data is gaining the attention from the research community, also driven by some relevant technological
                        innovations (like Clouds) as well as novel paradigms (like social networks), the issues of privacy and security of Big
                        Data represent a fundamental problem in this research context, due to the fact Big Data are typically published online
                        for supporting knowledge management and fruition processes and, in addition to this, such data are usually handled by
                        multiple owners, with possible secure multi-part computation issues. Some of the hot topics in the context privacy and
                        security of Big Data include: (i) privacy and security of Big Data integration and exchange; (ii) privacy and security
                        of Big Data in data-intensive Cloud computing; (iii) system architectures in support of privacy and security of Big
                        Data, e.g., GPUs: (iv) privacy and security issues of Big Data querying and analysis.<br><br>

                        <strong>The PSBD 2024 special session focuses on all the research aspects of privacy and security of Big Data. Among these, an
                        unrestricted list is the following one:</strong>

                        The 9th IEEE Special Session “Machine Learning on Big Data” (MLBD 2024) of the 
                        <a href="index.html">2024 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (IEEE BigData 2024)</a>
                        follows the great success of eight previous editions co-located with the IEEE BigData and IEEE
                        ICMLA conference series and focuses on machine learning models, techniques and algorithms related to Big Data, a vibrant
                        and challenging research context playing a leading role in the Machine Learning and Data Mining research communities.
                        Big data is gaining attention from researchers, being driven among others by technological innovations (such as cloud
                        interfaces) and novel paradigms (such as social networks). Devising and developing machine learning models, techniques
                        and algorithms for big data represent a fundamental problem stirred-up by the tremendous range of critical applications
                        incorporating machine learning tools in their core platforms. For example, in application settings where big data arise
                        and machine is useful, we recognize, among other things: (i) machine-learning-based processing (e.g., acquisition,
                        knowledge discovery, and so forth) over large-scale sensor networks introduces important advantages over classical
                        data-management-based approaches; similarly, (ii) medical and e-heath information systems usually include successful
                        machine learning tools for processing and mining very large graphs modelling patient-to-disease, patient-to-doctor, and
                        patient-to-therapy networks; (iii) genome data management and mining can gain important benefits from machine learning
                        algorithms. Some hot topics in machine learning on big data include: (i) machine learning on unconventional big data
                        sources (e.g., large-scale graphs in scientific applications, strongly-unstructured social networks, and so forth); (ii)
                        machine learning over massive big data in distributed settings; (iii) scalable machine learning algorithms; (iv) deep
                        learning – models, principles, issues; (v) machine-learning-based predictive approaches; (vi) machine-learning-based big
                        data analytics; (vii) privacy-preserving machine learning on big data; (viii) temporal analysis and spatial analysis on
                        big data; (ix) heterogeneous machine learning on big data; (x) novel applications of machine learning on big data (e.g.,
                        healthcare, cybersecurity, smart cities, and so forth).

                        Health data differs from other industries' data in terms of structure, context, importance, volatility, availability,
                        traceability, liquidity, change speed, usage and sources from which it is collected. As medicine is a constantly
                        developing science, healthcare sector also. In this new emerging research area which stands at the intersection of
                        several different discipline such as Medicine, Behavioral Science, Supply Chain Management or Big Data Analytics,
                        techniques, methods, applications and devices are continuously developed to be used for the acquisition, storage,
                        processing, analysis, standardization and optimization of every process in the health sector. As the healthcare sector
                        is so challenging and related data are consistently explosive, healthcare organizations are focusing to become smarter
                        in order to overcome the industry’s inefficiencies to improve quality of care. “To become smarter” requires impeccable
                        data analytics. All stakeholders in the sector should reveal the deep value of this valuable data in order to apply
                        insights to improve quality of care, clinical outcomes and deliver personalized healthcare value, while reducing medical
                        costs, collaborate across care settings to deliver integrated, personalized care experiences, prevent disease, promote
                        wellness and manage care, build flexibility into operations to support cost reduction and excellence in clinical and
                        business performance and practices.

                    <p>
                        Recent innovations with Big Data and Artificial Intelligence have created new markets and dramatically increased the
                        importance of data. Despite these social changes, existing economics, market design, management, information systems,
                        engineering, social science, and data science approaches to these new social issues have limitations. New market
                        understanding schemes and solutions for social implementation are needed. <br><br>
            
                        To address these gaps, we propose a special session named “Understanding New Markets by Data Science, Social Science,
                        and Economics” to discuss the processes and interactions among data, humans, and society with researchers from
                        engineering, information systems, data science, social science, management, and economics. The topics to be covered in
                        this session are practical issues for understanding new societies and markets, including analytical work with data and
                        solutions to complex social problems. The session will cover not only cleanly formatted, homogeneous data but also
                        heterogeneous data that influence human behavior, thinking, and intentions across different domains. Discussions will
                        focus on how large-scale data can be used in healthcare, business management, and public systems, as well as discussions
                        of quantitative assessments of what works in these areas and the obstacles to advancing their use. In addition to these
                        research areas, we will explore utilizing large-scale data and designing mechanisms and institutions that consider
                        social and cultural backgrounds across disciplines. We believe that this special session focusing on the new schemes for
                        market understanding and design will be of great significance to academia and society.<br><br>

                                As part of the ICDM (International Conference on Data Mining) workshops, we successfully conducted the 1st and 2nd International Workshop on CDEC at Singapore and Beijing (2018 and 2019). Seven distinguished papers were accepted after a triple blind review process (the acceptance rate: 43%) and presented to an audience of approximately 30 participants in 2018. In 2019, 10 papers have been accepted and been presented (the acceptance rate: 48%) after a triple blind review process. Thanks to the editors of MDPI, a special issue of CDEC was issued in the Information Journal (ISSN 2078-2489) under the section “Information and Communications Technology.” In 2020, we proposed the special session on IEEE BigData2020, and 4 distinguished papers have been presented online (the acceptance rate: 40%) after a triple blind review process. Moreover, we have had experience in conducting the workshops named “CDEC” in 2021 and named “New Strands of Usage of Big Data in Medical Systems, Market and Institutional Design, and Economic Theory” in 2022 on IEEE BigData.

                    <h4>Synergizing Mobility Data for Creating and Discovering Valuable Places</h4>
                    <b>December 15-18, 2024, Washington DC, USA</b><br>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Combining and utilizing data related to mobility in innovative ways, identifying, creating, and offering significant
                        value</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Scope</strong><br><br>
                        Places with the well-being of participants and the prosperity of the region may be regarded as a lively, active, and
                        bustling atmosphere associated with crowds - where a lot of people gather close to each other. However, not only
                        liveliness or activeness, but the mutual interaction of participants enhances the expected prosperity of the local
                        society which can grow to make a region preferable to live and work in.<br><br>

                        It is an open problem to discover such a place because the criteria for evaluating the value of things, events, or even
                        that information to be available about a place have not yet been established. For example, just a large number of
                        people, such as a marching army in which participants walk in the same direction, is not expected to create new value in
                        the place. Even if they are shouting to fire themselves up, that will not still make the place a residential town or a
                        market where various intellectual and commercial values emerge, which is often required to make a location valuable in
                        terms of sustainable prosperity. To enjoy such prosperity with creativity, a crowd, a workplace, a venue, or marketplace
                        should embrace the diversity of participants' interests and knowledge, which often cannot be evaluated in a few
                        dimensions of value criteria but should be combine with other sources of dimensions via physical, mental, and
                        intellectual interactions.<br><br>

                        Here, we stand on the belief that such a valued place is the basis of the sustainable prosperity of human society, where
                        a lively society with active markets is created via the synergetic interaction of individuals, which are observed as
                        activities involving movements, communication, and exchange of values and information. Through such activities, the
                        place can provide social, financial, physical, and community well-being to young, working, and elderly people to enjoy
                        wellness and careers by which they are working to develop the values evaluated in the created dimensions.<br><br>
                        
                        In this special session, we would like to have papers and presentations about methods or theories for creating,
                        collecting, combining, or utilizing data on the activities of humans or relevant events so that the values or potential
                        values of places can be discovered. We will have the keynote presentation by <b>Renate Fruchter</b>, Founding Director of the
                        Project Based Learning Laboratory (PBL Lab) at Stanford University, a designer of physical and virtual interactive

                        in her talk, although the target is "places" where a space turns into a valued environment for human(s) to live in, the
                        information useful for adding value to the place and fostering social interactions of individuals can be beyond what we
                        believe "mobility data" are. We should involve data on human words, thoughts, health, weather etc., for mining values
                        that may have been invisible or undetected so far. The authors are welcome to show approaches for creating and using
                        novel data as well as novel values in the places. Hence, we communicate studies using mobility data or their extensions
                        for value discovery and creation.

                    <strong>Abstract</strong>
                    <p>
                        Data is the most important property for bringing innovation and digital transformation. By using highly developed
                        information and communication technology, we can generate, store, replicate, transfer, process and analyze data at very
                        low cost, which realizes democratization of innovation, that is to give everyone in the world a chance for innovation.
                        Today, the world is using the power of data to solve all kinds of issues, from global ones to everyday life ones.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Data-driven society achieves both economic development and resolution of social problems in parallel by connecting
                        everyone and everything with each other, sharing various knowledge and information, and creating new value. From the
                        perspective of economy, it will contribute to sustainable and harmonious economic development in the world. On the other
                        hands, from the perspective of domestic social issues, it will contribute to the sustainability of regions and national
                        security, including the declining birthrate, increasing aging population, depopulation of rural areas, economic
                        disparity, and prevention of natural disasters and pandemics. For this purpose, vast Big Data in cyber space (virtual
                        space) and physical space (real space) are linked across all over the world among various stakeholders to realize the
                        vision of "Dataspace" and "Data Free Flow with Trust" (DFFT). The privacy, security, quality assurance and ease of use
                        of the data itself must also be considered.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The general purpose of this special session in IEEE BigData 2024 conference is to bring together researchers,
                        academicians, and sector employees from different fields and disciplines and to exchange information on their practical
                        activities, research, ideas and findings about Dataspaces and platforms for DFFT. It is also aimed to encourage debate
                        on how global platform can effectively support big data distribution, sharing, and application in terms of
                        infrastructure, technology, governance, business, and so on, and to develop a common understanding for research
                        conducted in this multidisciplinary field.
