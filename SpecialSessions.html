                        <strong>Aim and Scope</strong><br>
                        The 11th IEEE Special Session “Privacy and Security of Big Data” (PSBD 2024) of the 
                        <a href="index.html">2024 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (IEEE BigData 2024)</a> 
                        follows the great success of ten previous editions co-located with the IEEE BigData and
                        ACM CIKM conference series and focuses the attention on privacy and security research issues in the context of Big Data,
                        a vibrant and challenging research context which is playing a leading role in the Database research community. Indeed,
                        while Big Data is gaining the attention from the research community, also driven by some relevant technological
                        innovations (like Clouds) as well as novel paradigms (like social networks), the issues of privacy and security of Big
                        Data represent a fundamental problem in this research context, due to the fact Big Data are typically published online
                        for supporting knowledge management and fruition processes and, in addition to this, such data are usually handled by
                        multiple owners, with possible secure multi-part computation issues. Some of the hot topics in the context privacy and
                        security of Big Data include: (i) privacy and security of Big Data integration and exchange; (ii) privacy and security
                        of Big Data in data-intensive Cloud computing; (iii) system architectures in support of privacy and security of Big
                        Data, e.g., GPUs: (iv) privacy and security issues of Big Data querying and analysis.<br><br>

                        <strong>The PSBD 2024 special session focuses on all the research aspects of privacy and security of Big Data. Among these, an

                        <a href="index.html">2024 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (IEEE BigData 2024)</a>
                        follows the great success of eight previous editions co-located with the IEEE BigData and IEEE
                        ICMLA conference series and focuses on machine learning models, techniques and algorithms related to Big Data, a vibrant
                        and challenging research context playing a leading role in the Machine Learning and Data Mining research communities.
                        Big data is gaining attention from researchers, being driven among others by technological innovations (such as cloud
                        interfaces) and novel paradigms (such as social networks). Devising and developing machine learning models, techniques
                        and algorithms for big data represent a fundamental problem stirred-up by the tremendous range of critical applications
                        incorporating machine learning tools in their core platforms. For example, in application settings where big data arise
                        and machine is useful, we recognize, among other things: (i) machine-learning-based processing (e.g., acquisition,
                        knowledge discovery, and so forth) over large-scale sensor networks introduces important advantages over classical
                        data-management-based approaches; similarly, (ii) medical and e-heath information systems usually include successful
                        machine learning tools for processing and mining very large graphs modelling patient-to-disease, patient-to-doctor, and
                        patient-to-therapy networks; (iii) genome data management and mining can gain important benefits from machine learning
                        algorithms. Some hot topics in machine learning on big data include: (i) machine learning on unconventional big data

                    <p>
                        Health data differs from other industries' data in terms of structure, context, importance, volatility, availability,
                        traceability, liquidity, change speed, usage and sources from which it is collected. As medicine is a constantly
                        developing science, healthcare sector also. In this new emerging research area which stands at the intersection of
                        several different discipline such as Medicine, Behavioral Science, Supply Chain Management or Big Data Analytics,
                        techniques, methods, applications and devices are continuously developed to be used for the acquisition, storage,
                        processing, analysis, standardization and optimization of every process in the health sector. As the healthcare sector
                        is so challenging and related data are consistently explosive, healthcare organizations are focusing to become smarter
                        in order to overcome the industry’s inefficiencies to improve quality of care. “To become smarter” requires impeccable
                        data analytics. All stakeholders in the sector should reveal the deep value of this valuable data in order to apply
                        insights to improve quality of care, clinical outcomes and deliver personalized healthcare value, while reducing medical
                        costs, collaborate across care settings to deliver integrated, personalized care experiences, prevent disease, promote
                        wellness and manage care, build flexibility into operations to support cost reduction and excellence in clinical and
                        business performance and practices.

                        The general purpose of this special session in IEEE BigData 2024 conference is to bring together researchers,
                        academicians and sector employees from different fields and disciplines and provide them an independent platform to
                        exchange information on their researches, ideas and findings about healthcare data and its analytics. It is also aimed
                        to encourage debate on how big data can effectively support healthcare in terms of diagnosis, treatment and population
                        health, and to develop a common understanding for research conducted in this multidisciplinary field.
