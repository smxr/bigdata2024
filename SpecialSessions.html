                        <strong>Aim and Scope</strong><br>
                        The 11th IEEE Special Session “Privacy and Security of Big Data” (PSBD 2024) of the
                        <a href="index.html">2024 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (IEEE BigData 2024)</a>
                        follows the great success of ten previous editions co-located with the IEEE BigData and
                        ACM CIKM conference series and focuses the attention on privacy and security research issues in
                        the context of Big Data,
                        a vibrant and challenging research context which is playing a leading role in the Database
                        research community. Indeed,
                        while Big Data is gaining the attention from the research community, also driven by some
                        relevant technological
                        innovations (like Clouds) as well as novel paradigms (like social networks), the issues of
                        privacy and security of Big
                        Data represent a fundamental problem in this research context, due to the fact Big Data are
                        typically published online
                        for supporting knowledge management and fruition processes and, in addition to this, such data
                        are usually handled by
                        multiple owners, with possible secure multi-part computation issues. Some of the hot topics in
                        the context privacy and
                        security of Big Data include: (i) privacy and security of Big Data integration and exchange;
                        (ii) privacy and security
                        of Big Data in data-intensive Cloud computing; (iii) system architectures in support of privacy
                        and security of Big
                        Data, e.g., GPUs: (iv) privacy and security issues of Big Data querying and analysis.<br><br>

                        <strong>The PSBD 2024 special session focuses on all the research aspects of privacy and
                            security of Big Data. Among these, an

                        <strong>Aim and Scope</strong><br>
                        The 9th IEEE Special Session “Machine Learning on Big Data” (MLBD 2024) of the
                        <a href="index.html">2024 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (IEEE BigData 2024)</a>
                        follows the great success of eight previous editions co-located with the IEEE BigData and IEEE
                        ICMLA conference series and focuses on machine learning models, techniques and algorithms
                        related to Big Data, a vibrant
                        and challenging research context playing a leading role in the Machine Learning and Data Mining
                        research communities.
                        Big data is gaining attention from researchers, being driven among others by technological
                        innovations (such as cloud
                        interfaces) and novel paradigms (such as social networks). Devising and developing machine
                        learning models, techniques
                        and algorithms for big data represent a fundamental problem stirred-up by the tremendous range
                        of critical applications
                        incorporating machine learning tools in their core platforms. For example, in application
                        settings where big data arise
                        and machine is useful, we recognize, among other things: (i) machine-learning-based processing
                        (e.g., acquisition,
                        knowledge discovery, and so forth) over large-scale sensor networks introduces important
                        advantages over classical
                        data-management-based approaches; similarly, (ii) medical and e-heath information systems
                        usually include successful
                        machine learning tools for processing and mining very large graphs modelling patient-to-disease,
                        patient-to-doctor, and
                        patient-to-therapy networks; (iii) genome data management and mining can gain important benefits
                        from machine learning
                        algorithms. Some hot topics in machine learning on big data include: (i) machine learning on
                        unconventional big data
                        sources (e.g., large-scale graphs in scientific applications, strongly-unstructured social
                        networks, and so forth); (ii)
                        machine learning over massive big data in distributed settings; (iii) scalable machine learning
                        algorithms; (iv) deep
                        learning - models, principles, issues; (v) machine-learning-based predictive approaches; (vi)
                        machine-learning-based big
                        data analytics; (vii) privacy-preserving machine learning on big data; (viii) temporal analysis
                        and spatial analysis on
                        big data; (ix) heterogeneous machine learning on big data; (x) novel applications of machine
                        learning on big data (e.g.,
                        healthcare, cybersecurity, smart cities, and so forth).

                        Big Data. MLBD 2024
                        will provide a stimulating environment to encourage discussion, fellowship, and exchange of
                        ideas in all aspects of
                        research related to Machine Learning on Big Data. This includes both original research
                        contributions and insights from
                        practical system design, implementation and evaluation, along with new research directions and
                        emerging application
                        domains in the target area. An expected outcome from MLBD 2024 is the identification of new
                        problems in the main topics,
                        and moves to achieve consolidated solutions to already-known problems. Other goals are to help
                        in creating a focused
                        community of scientists who create and drive interest in the area of Machine Learning on Big
                        Data, and additionally to

                    <h4>7th Special Session on HealthCare Data in IEEE Big Data 2024</h4>
                    <b>December 15-18, 2024, Washington DC, USA</b><br>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Health data differs from other industries' data in terms of structure, context, importance,
                        volatility, availability,
                        traceability, liquidity, change speed, usage and sources from which it is collected. As medicine
                        is a constantly
                        developing science, healthcare sector also. In this new emerging research area which stands at
                        the intersection of
                        several different discipline such as Medicine, Behavioral Science, Supply Chain Management or
                        Big Data Analytics,
                        techniques, methods, applications and devices are continuously developed to be used for the
                        acquisition, storage,
                        processing, analysis, standardization and optimization of every process in the health sector. As
                        the healthcare sector
                        is so challenging and related data are consistently explosive, healthcare organizations are
                        focusing to become smarter
                        in order to overcome the industry's inefficiencies to improve quality of care. “To become
                        smarter” requires impeccable
                        data analytics. All stakeholders in the sector should reveal the deep value of this valuable
                        data in order to apply
                        insights to improve quality of care, clinical outcomes and deliver personalized healthcare
                        value, while reducing medical
                        costs, collaborate across care settings to deliver integrated, personalized care experiences,
                        prevent disease, promote
                        wellness and manage care, build flexibility into operations to support cost reduction and
                        excellence in clinical and
                        business performance and practices.

                    </h4>
                    <b>December 15-18, 2024, Washington DC, USA</b><br>

                    <p>
                        Recent innovations with Big Data and Artificial Intelligence have created new markets and
                        dramatically increased the
                        importance of data. Despite these social changes, existing economics, market design, management,
                        information systems,
                        engineering, social science, and data science approaches to these new social issues have
                        limitations. New market
                        understanding schemes and solutions for social implementation are needed. <br><br>

                        To address these gaps, we propose a special session named “Understanding New Markets by Data
                        Science, Social Science,
                        and Economics” to discuss the processes and interactions among data, humans, and society with
                        researchers from
                        engineering, information systems, data science, social science, management, and economics. The
                        topics to be covered in
                        this session are practical issues for understanding new societies and markets, including
                        analytical work with data and
                        solutions to complex social problems. The session will cover not only cleanly formatted,
                        homogeneous data but also
                        heterogeneous data that influence human behavior, thinking, and intentions across different
                        domains. Discussions will
                        focus on how large-scale data can be used in healthcare, business management, and public
                        systems, as well as discussions
                        of quantitative assessments of what works in these areas and the obstacles to advancing their
                        use. In addition to these
                        research areas, we will explore utilizing large-scale data and designing mechanisms and
                        institutions that consider
                        social and cultural backgrounds across disciplines. We believe that this special session
                        focusing on the new schemes for
                        market understanding and design will be of great significance to academia and society.<br><br>

                        <strong>Combining and utilizing data related to mobility in innovative ways, identifying,
                            creating, and offering significant
                            value</strong>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Scope</strong><br><br>
                        Places with the well-being of participants and the prosperity of the region may be regarded as a
                        lively, active, and
                        bustling atmosphere associated with crowds - where a lot of people gather close to each other.
                        However, not only
                        liveliness or activeness, but the mutual interaction of participants enhances the expected
                        prosperity of the local
                        society which can grow to make a region preferable to live and work in.<br><br>

                        It is an open problem to discover such a place because the criteria for evaluating the value of
                        things, events, or even
                        that information to be available about a place have not yet been established. For example, just
                        a large number of
                        people, such as a marching army in which participants walk in the same direction, is not
                        expected to create new value in
                        the place. Even if they are shouting to fire themselves up, that will not still make the place a
                        residential town or a
                        market where various intellectual and commercial values emerge, which is often required to make
                        a location valuable in
                        terms of sustainable prosperity. To enjoy such prosperity with creativity, a crowd, a workplace,
                        a venue, or marketplace
                        should embrace the diversity of participants' interests and knowledge, which often cannot be
                        evaluated in a few
                        dimensions of value criteria but should be combine with other sources of dimensions via
                        physical, mental, and
                        intellectual interactions.<br><br>

                        Here, we stand on the belief that such a valued place is the basis of the sustainable prosperity
                        of human society, where
                        a lively society with active markets is created via the synergetic interaction of individuals,
                        which are observed as
                        activities involving movements, communication, and exchange of values and information. Through
                        such activities, the
                        place can provide social, financial, physical, and community well-being to young, working, and
                        elderly people to enjoy
                        wellness and careers by which they are working to develop the values evaluated in the created
                        dimensions.<br><br>

                        In this special session, we would like to have papers and presentations about methods or
                        theories for creating,
                        collecting, combining, or utilizing data on the activities of humans or relevant events so that
                        the values or potential
                        values of places can be discovered.

                         We should involve data on human words, thoughts, health, weather

                        that may have been invisible or undetected so far. The authors are welcome to show approaches
                        for creating and using
                        novel data as well as novel values in the places. Hence, we communicate studies using mobility

                    <strong>Abstract</strong>
                    <p>
                        Data is the most important property for bringing innovation and digital transformation. By using
                        highly developed
                        information and communication technology, we can generate, store, replicate, transfer, process
                        and analyze data at very
                        low cost, which realizes democratization of innovation, that is to give everyone in the world a
                        chance for innovation.
                        Today, the world is using the power of data to solve all kinds of issues, from global ones to
                        everyday life ones.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Data-driven society achieves both economic development and resolution of social problems in
                        parallel by connecting
                        everyone and everything with each other, sharing various knowledge and information, and creating
                        new value. From the
                        perspective of economy, it will contribute to sustainable and harmonious economic development in
                        the world. On the other
                        hands, from the perspective of domestic social issues, it will contribute to the sustainability
                        of regions and national
                        security, including the declining birthrate, increasing aging population, depopulation of rural
                        areas, economic
                        disparity, and prevention of natural disasters and pandemics. For this purpose, vast Big Data in
                        cyber space (virtual
                        space) and physical space (real space) are linked across all over the world among various
                        stakeholders to realize the
                        vision of "Dataspace" and "Data Free Flow with Trust" (DFFT). The privacy, security, quality
                        assurance and ease of use
                        of the data itself must also be considered.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The general purpose of this special session in IEEE BigData 2024 conference is to bring together
                        researchers,
                        academicians, and sector employees from different fields and disciplines and to exchange
                        information on their practical
                        activities, research, ideas and findings about Dataspaces and platforms for DFFT. It is also
                        aimed to encourage debate
                        on how global platform can effectively support big data distribution, sharing, and application
                        in terms of
                        infrastructure, technology, governance, business, and so on, and to develop a common
                        understanding for research
                        conducted in this multidisciplinary field.

                        <b>Aim and Scope</b><br><br>

                        The "Special Session on Federated Learning on Big Data" aims to bring together researchers,
                        industry practitioners, and
                        policymakers to explore cutting-edge advancements and address pressing challenges in the
                        application of federated
                        learning to Big Data. Federated learning is revolutionizing the way organizations handle machine
                        learning across
                        distributed data sources, enabling collaborative model training without compromising data
                        privacy. With the
                        proliferation of data from various sources such as healthcare, finance, IoT, and multimedia,
                        this session provides an
                        invaluable opportunity to delve into the practical and theoretical aspects of federated
                        learning, focusing on its
                        integration with the 5Vs of Big Data: Volume, Velocity, Variety, Value, and Veracity.<br><br>

                        The session will highlight recent innovations in federated learning algorithms and frameworks
                        designed to handle the
                        unique challenges posed by Big Data, such as heterogeneous data distributions and resource
                        constraints. Furthermore, it
                        will explore the interplay between federated learning and privacy-preserving mechanisms,
                        ensuring secure data exchange
                        across institutions and organizations. Special emphasis will be placed on real-world
                        applications in healthcare, IoT,
                        and finance, where federated learning allows organizations to harness the potential of
                        decentralized data while
                        respecting privacy regulations.<br><br>

                        We aim to foster cross-disciplinary collaboration and knowledge-sharing that leads to new
                        methods, architectures, and
                        systems that push the boundaries of federated learning research. This session will also shed
                        light on the emerging
                        policy and ethical considerations in the deployment of federated learning models, providing a
                        comprehensive view of this
                        rapidly evolving field. Ultimately, our goal is to build a vibrant community that propels
                        federated learning into a
                        pivotal role in addressing the challenges and opportunities of Big Data analytics.

                        <strong>Brief Description and Justification</strong><br>
                        The growing popularity of Autonomous Guided Vehicles (AGVs) has not only been the result of their technical
                        features but also their ability to cooperate. Cooperative-based internal logistics enables increased
                        production flexibility. AGVs have become a key enabling technology for the flexible internal logistics that
                        are required for agile production systems. Modern production systems are characterized by frequent changes
                        that result from orders that are changed by customers, low material buffers, the agile production
                        technologies that are performed by robotized production stands and the many variants of production
                        technology that can be used. All of the above-mentioned factors require the production process to be
                        supported online by highly advanced information services, which are performed during successive steps in the
                        production chain. In addition, big and remote sensing data play a fundamental role in AGV, which helps
                        acquire the patterns of driving/travel behaviour, human mobility, and traffic flow, and in sensing a more
                        large-scale environment and giving more accurate, traffic-aware navigation. This means that the production
                        activities cannot be centrally planned but have to be performed cooperatively concerning the sensing data,
                        ongoing production tasks, available materials, production equipment and technologies. The new generation of
                        data-driven systems in AGVs has to support the autonomy and distribution of decision-making processes.
                        Thus, this special session is focused on the following issues but not limited to:

                    <strong>BACKGROUND:</strong><br>
                        Granular Computing is a general computation approach for a usage of information granules such as data blocks, clusters,
                        groups, as well as value intervals, sets, hierarchies, etc., to build efficient computational models for complex Big
                        Data applications, characterized by huge amounts of diverse data and associated domain knowledge. Information
                        Granulation, under different names, has appeared in many fields, such as granularity in artificial intelligence, divide
                        and conquer methods for scaling calculations, approximate computing, knowledge representation, topological data
                        analysis, image processing, deep learning and many others related with human and machine intelligence. Recently,
                        coarse-grained approaches in convolutional networks have been paid attention to theorical analysis of deep learning from
                        physics. Physicist pointed out that Renormalization flow controls the behavior of deep neural networks, whose mechanism
                        is corresponding to the control of granularity in information theory.
                        <br><br>
                        The principles of Granular Computing can be also helpful to design simplified descriptions of complex data systems and
                        to bridge the gap between the humans and AI. Herein we may follow the phrase "Information Granules = Fundamental Pieces
                        of Human Knowledge" and treat Granular Computing as one of important meta-mathematical methodologies for Big Data
                        Analytics.

                        <strong>SESSION SCOPE:</strong><br>
                        The 10th session in this series continues to address the theory and practice of derivations and computations based on
                        various types of granular models and structures. It provides researchers from both academia and industry with the means
                        to present the state-of-the-art results and methodologies related to Information Granulation and Granular Computing,
                        with a special emphasis on applications in Data Science and Scalable Computing. The session also refers - from the
                        particular viewpoint of Information Granulation - to currently important research tracks such as social network
                        computing, cloud computing, cyber-security, data mining, process mining, machine learning, statistics, knowledge
                        management, AI-based systems, soft computing, e-Intelligence, business intelligence, bioinformatics, health informatics
                        and IoT. The papers addressing Information Granulation in the emerging field of XAI and using its principles to
                        construct interpretable AI models are highly welcome as well. Particularly, we encourage the papers which deliver
                        experimental results but in the same time, provide theoretical foundations to justify those results.

                        The session is organized as a part of the IEEE Big Data 2024 conference (December 15-18), which is a well-established
                        and competitive international event targeted at modern trends in big data processing and analytics.
                        <br><br>
                        The session is intended to be a forum for discussing ideas, issues and methods based on and inspired by Information
                        Granulation and Granular Computing, in an atmosphere promoting free exchange of viewpoints and perspectives coming from
                        different application areas.
                        <br><br>
                        Papers accepted to the session will be published in the IEEE Big Data 2024 conference proceedings, together with papers
                        accepted to the main conference track.
                        <br><br>
                        Organizers are planning a special issue in a relevant scientific journal, such as Big Data Research (Elsevier), Granular
                        Computing (Springer) or Big Data Mining and Analytics (Tsinghua University Press).
                        <br><br>
                        Organizers particularly encourage papers which deliver experimental results but in the same time, provide theoretical
                        foundations to justify those results.
