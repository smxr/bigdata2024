                        <li>
                            From Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA): Located closest to the city, DCA is just 5 miles from the
                            Convention Center. The quickest option is to take a ride-share service like Uber or Lyft directly to your destination.
                            Alternatively, you may opt for the Metro's Blue Line. From the airport's Track 1 platform, board the Blue Line train
                            toward LARGO and disembark at the Federal Triangle station, which is a short 10-minute walk to the Convention Center.
                            For more transit options, please consult 
                            <a href="https://www.rome2rio.com/map/Reagan-Washington-Airport-DCA/Hyatt-Regency-Washington-on-Capitol-Hill#trips"><B>here</B></a>.

                        <li>
                            From Washington Dulles International Airport (IAD): Approximately 31.9 miles from downtown DC, IAD offers both subway
                            and bus options. To take the Metro, board the Silver Line from the airport's center platform toward LARGO and alight at
                            the Federal Triangle station, approximately one mile from the Convention Center. For bus service, Megabus provides a
                            convenient route to Washington Union Station, a major transit hub located a 7-minute walk from the venue. Note that
                            Megabus operates on a limited schedule, with only one daily trip, so please check availability in advance. [For more

                            From Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport (BWI): Located about 43.6 miles from DC, BWI provides
                            bus services connecting to the MARC and Amtrak train systems. Take the BWI Airport Shuttle or Maryland Transit Route 75
                            to the BWI MARC station. From there, you may board either MARC or Amtrak trains heading to Washington's Union Station,
                            which is just an 8-minute walk from the Convention Center. [For more details on transit options, see
